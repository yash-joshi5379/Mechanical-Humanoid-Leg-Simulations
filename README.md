# Mechanical-Humanoid-Leg-Simulations

This repository contains a modular MATLAB simulation suite for a multi-jointed robotic leg. The project focuses on the kinematic modeling, 3D visualization, and design optimization of three primary joint assemblies: a 3-DOF Spherical Parallel Manipulator (Hip), a Crossed Four-Bar Linkage (Knee), and a Worm-Driven Linkage (Ankle).

## 🚀 Quick Start

To simulate the entire integrated leg system, run the master script:
```matlab
run('Leg.m')
```


Run Leg.m to simulate the whole system

Run SPM.m to simulate the hip joint

Run CrossFourBar.m to simulate the knee joint

Run WormDrive.m to simulate the ankle joint
